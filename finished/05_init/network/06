The resolver is a set of routines in the C library that provide
access to the Internet Domain Name System (DNS).
The resolver configuration file contains information
that is read by the resolver routines the first time
they are invoked by a process.
The file is designed to be human readable
and contains a list of keywords with values
that provide various types of resolver information.
